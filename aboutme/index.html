<h2> The Basic Overview:</h2>
<main>
<div class="firstpara">
<p>My name is Charlotte Ashley, a 19-year-old Publishing and Journalism student at Oxford Brookes University with a passion for spilling my thoughts out in word form. I have grown up with a desire to write about everything with such sophistication and professionalism; from such a young age I have had a love for words, reading dictionaries at the age of 2 was my speciality.</p>
<p>I studied English Literature, Media Studies and History at A-Level and did surprisngly well considering I was the year group where exams got cancelled due to COVID. My home town isn't too far from Oxford, in Buckinghamshire and I've lived there all my life with my mum, dad and brother; I work part time as a waitress both in Oxford and at home when it's not term-time. </p>

<h2>Achievements Regarding Writing:</h2>
<main>
<div class="firstpara">
  <ul>
<li>In primary school, I had two short stories published into two story books with the acknowledgement that I'd written them.</li>
<li>Additionally, I was chosen to write a student perspective about the university course I study, which is to be put onto the Brookes website on the course page.</li>
<li>One of my own personal articles about the COVID outbreak, was put onto my secondary schools' twitter account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why have I chosen the topic of typography in print media?</h2>
<main>
<div class="firstpara">
<p>My favourite type of media is print: magazines, newspapers, books; therefore I found it to only make sense that I create a blog in which analyses what I enjoy best.</p>

<h2>My Favourite Books:</h2>
<main>
<div class="firstpara">
<p>These three books in particular stand out to me as good reads, I read 'The Great Gatsby' as an A-Level case study and the other two out of leisure. Which I found all three gripping and easy to analyse and understand.</p>
