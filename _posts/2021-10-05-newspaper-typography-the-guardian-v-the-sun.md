Newspaper typography is a vital factor when portraying the correct ideology and representation that newspapers wants to demonstrate for their demographic audiences. The typefaces chosen creates the brand of the newspaper as it targets audiences, ideas and beliefs. 

Looking at two newspapers which are on opposite ends of the spectrum; *The Guardian* and *The Sun*, it becomes evident that typography plays a powerful role in the construction of print media and it is what is recognised by millions for their individual reputation. 

### *The Guardian:*

The Guardian newspaper title is the font 'guardian egyptian' which is a type face of a slab-serif, it was designed by Christian Schwartz and Paul Barnes in 2004. The masthead of the broadsheet connotes sophistication due to the serif typeface as it shows traditional and old-fashioned aspects, linking to the target audience of older readers moreso 35+. The type characteristics prove to be a heavy weight, which conveys strong opinionated newspaper as its bold, highlighitng confidence. This portrayal is further emphasised by the low contrast, opposing a fragile representation, it is demostrating the ideas and ideologies within the newspapers are assertive and striking. The actual print newspaper changed the typography of their masthead in 2012 where previously it was all lower cased and in blue, with a blue background. The updated version proves more sophisticated, espcially as the black is more of a formal professional colour comapred to blue. The added use of the capital letters also helps the assertive tone and makes the cover look more put together, compared to the old masthead of lower lettering, one could argue it doesn't show confidence in what the newspaper stands for.
