As previously discussed, it has been demonstrated that typography is essential to the branding of print media. Looking at the phenomenon of the Harry Potter book sequal, a unique font is used to differentiate their trademark from other brandings; especially on the book covers. However, as the novels are so popular multiple covers have been released; all proving to convey different typefaces chosen for the title on the front page.
