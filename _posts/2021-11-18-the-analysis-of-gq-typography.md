GQ magazine is an 'American international monthly men's magazine based in New York City' with a print readership of 10.7 million per month. Founded in 1931, the first men's magazine is aimed at young males aged 18-25 of a higher demographic audience. The modern magazine shows sophistication but youthfulness through the use of typography choices made and focuses on the publication of topics:

* Fashion
* Style and Culture for men
* Food
* Movies
* Fitness
* Sex
* Sports

## Masthead Choices

On the front cover of the GQ magazines, the masthead is the typeface *'Gotham.'* This is a sans-serif font which was designed by American Type Designer Tobias Frere-Jones, and released in 2000. The inspiration of the creation for the font came from examples of architectural signs of the mid 1900s. The title is of a '*heavy weight'* which proves the bold aspect to stand out, connoting a bold statement from the magazine. Its *'regular width'*  is shown by the overlap of the two letters, with a *'low contrast'* aiding its' boldness and attempt to stand out to consumers. The capitalisation used is to emphasis that '*bold statement'* which is styled through the *'heavy weight'.*

The masthead typeface choice indicates a modern and sleek look. The use of a sans-serif font being used as the title of the magazine cover suggests the piece of print media is aimed at a more younger audience. The font is seen as a more contemporary, sleek font compared to serif which shows more traditional and professional qualities. 

## Cover Lines

The typography of the GQ magazine cover lines differ between sans-serif and serif font with the array of *heavy weight* styles and bolded words.
