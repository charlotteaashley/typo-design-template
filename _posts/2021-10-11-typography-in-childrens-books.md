Using the correct typography on the cover of and inside children's book is one of the most important factors of its success. It is what invites the young audience to pick up the book on the bookshelf and allows them to engage with what's in the novel, especially as these books are aiding their development in terms of vocabulary, learning and being a key part of childhood.

### The History of The Typography of Children's Books 

Looking at the history of typography used within children novels, typefaces used tended to be a serif font. Serif typeface fonts such as 'Humanist' and 'Transitional' were the most popular amongst childrens books due to their typography characteristics. The *'high x-height'* within both fonts enables the text to be easily read and highlights larger sized letters against the other serif fonts that would be used in novels. A characteristic of *'wide bracketed serifs'* are formatted witihin the two fonts, it displays as the 'curved connection' between the end points of the letter. Having wide brackets aids the children to identify the letter easier. *'Large counters'* help the text to be easily read and understood by the children; closed counters are letters with no open 'mouths' within the letter, such as 'A,B,O,Q' compared to open counters such as 'C,F,H,I,S'. Having enlarged counters helps the child read them clearly.
