Cook books have a distinctive typography choice throughout all books published - serif typefaces. Titles of books consist of Georgia, Adobe Garamond Pro, Minion Pro, Palatino, Baskerville, and Goudy Old Style typefaces; these tend to be easier to read in printed books. 

## Cookbook Titles

On the covers of cook book recipe books, traditional typefaces which are used within the body are enlarged and bolded to be used as the masthead, this allows the book to have a consitent font theme throughout. The titles of cookbooks tend to be all capitalised or not at all; capitalised mastheads are used to attract readers whereas small text titles are more simplistic and suggest a more straightforward recipe book.
